            <p class="text-justify fs-5">Performed on the celestial tunes of the Carnatic music, Bharatnatyam comes from the state of Tamil Nadu in South. The origins of Bharatnatyam can be traced back to 1000 BC, and it originates from the ancient temples of Tamil Nadu performed by the women of the classical period. The dance form is known for its beautiful body movements and gestures which are called Mudras in the traditional language.
            It focuses on the hand gestures, leg movement and the facial expressions of the dancer. This dance form was very prevalent before the British era but was profoundly depressed during the colonial period. However, India kept the dance form alive in the houses, and today it is recognised as one of the most respectable art forms in India especially in the Southern region of the country where it is a moment of pride for the women of the house to learn the classical dance form of Bharatnatyam.

          Uttar Pradesh, North India

      </div>
      <div class="card-text">
        <p class="text-justify fs-5">Coming from the northern part of the country from the state of Uttar Pradesh, Kathak comes from the word 'Katha' which means "story" in Hindi. It isn't a very smart guess for one to make that Kathak is performed in the form of storytelling through the body movements used by the dancer. Kathak is often referred to as the dance of love, and it can be performed by both by the male and female dancer together. This dance form focuses highly on the ankle movements complemented by the ankle that has to match the beats of the music. Ankle bells or gunghroos as they are called in the traditional language is an important part of the discipline of this dance form.

      Andhra Pradesh</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="card-text">
    <p class="text-justify fs-5">Belonging to the Andhra Pradesh, Kuchipudi is probably the toughest form of classical dance in India. Kuchipudi is not just considered as the dance but a whole religious procedure dedicated to God which includes certain rituals such as sprinkling the holy water, burning the incense sticks and praying to God. Kuchipudi includes both singing and dancing by the performer which is why it requires both the skill and much more dedication than any other art forms in India. In the earlier period, Kuchipudi was only performed by the male dancers in the temples, specifically the Brahmins( Upper caste of the society) but with the passage of time, it became famous amongst the women and nowadays it is mostly performed by the female dancers.

<h2> Kathakali <br>
  Kerala, South India</h2>
</div>
<div class="card-text">
<p class="text-justify fs-5">Kathakali is another traditional dance form of India which relates to the storytelling. Kathakali translates to the 'storyteller' in the country's language. Coming from the Southern region of the country from Kerala, Kathakali is one of the most renowned and religious dances forms of India. It originates from the tales of Ramayana and Shiva stories. Kathakali includes the intriguing face movements and the heavy costumes which include the traditional face masks and body paints (generally green). The music which includes only the vocals is called Soppanam. The storytelling of the epic Hindu mythology tales depicting both evil and good is shown through the conversation between the dancers only through their body gestures and facial expressions. Simply fascinating to watch!Kathakali is a blend of dance, music and acting and dramatizes stories, which are mostly adapted from the Indian epics. It is a stylised art form, the four aspects of abhinaya â€“ angika, aharya,vachika, satvika and the nritta, nritya and natya aspects are combined perfectly.The five major Veshams in Kathakali are Kathi (Knife), Pacha (Green), Thaadi (Beard), Minukku (radiant), and Kari (Black). 
The hand gestures of Kathakali, called mudras, are like the alphabets of the language.

        <div class="card-text">
        <p class="text-justify fs-5">Kicking comes from martial arts and is about strength, fluidity, and precision. There are three types of kicking: Front kicks (with or without a weight shift), roundhouse kicks, and back kicks. To dance kickboxingâ€”or to perform it for your martial arts schoolâ€”you need to know front kick boxing moves, roundhouse kick moves, and back kick boxing moves. But if you want to learn a form that more closely resembles performance dancing than fighting in combat (like ballet), look into western classical dance forms. Not all classical western dances include kicking; however, many have turned their attention to strong jumps instead. Ballet dancersâ€”especially women in pointe shoesâ€”are especially known for their high jumps.

Itâ€™s also a partner-based dance that incorporates a lot of attitude and contact between partners. The music tends to be funky, and often has rock, hip-hop or jazz influences. Itâ€™s not hard to see why it became popular with inmates! There are a number of different variations within Locking, so you can watch performances from all over in order to get an idea for what it might look like.
